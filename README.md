# MeetupAutoJoin
 
## Problem I'm addressing 

I know some meetup groups that have events I really want to go to but their events get filled up quickly. Well, solution? I'll create a bot to auto join their events. May be unfair to other people in the group but i'm going to rationalize it by knowing that I'm a patreon of the group I'm trying to get into events for. :) 

I'm just getting into the python scripting world so this is my first project really focusing on that.

## Ideal Complete Functionality

For each link --> list of events that currently exist organized by date

Every hour --> new event not on list? 

New event --> auto attend --> text notification. 

## Setup

Don't forget to download the webdriver you'd like to use

setup your venv

pip install -r requirements.txt
